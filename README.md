RemapHJKL
=========

the down key on my keyboard broke, so I've improvised

This app toggles the keyboard state into *vim navigation mode* which remaps HJKL to the arrow keys. That's it. This is only because my down arrow key broke and I really need that key.

To switch the layout into *vim navigation mode* press `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`3`. To switch back out, press `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`3` again.

TODO
====

More vimness! In particular:

* [x] smarter icon that reflects the current state (e.g. `i` and `n`)
* [x] ~~`^D` & `^U`~~ as F and B for now
* [x] `^` & `$`
* [ ] `G`
* [ ] `y`, `d`, `p`
* [ ] maybe registers someday
* [ ] visual mode
